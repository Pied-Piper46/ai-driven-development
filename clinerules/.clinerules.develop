        - Tasks (by default)
        - Reference
        - and so on...
    - Labels: Add "todo" by default

## Branch Creation
- Branch name format: `<feature/bugfix/...>/<issue-number>-<shot-description>`
- Create branches from `main`

## Code Implementation
- Generate unit tests for all new functions/components

## Commit
- Commit changes when:
    - A logical unit of work is complete (e.g., function implementation, test case)
    - Tests pass locally
- Commit message format: `#<issue-number> Brief description of changes`

## Testing
- Run tests locally before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before pushing

## CI/CD YAML Editing
- Update `.github/workflows/<>.yml` with:
    - Branch name in `on.push.branches`
    - Correct test command and file (e.g., `npm test` or `pytest`)

## Commit & Push
- Commit and Push after all local tests pass and CI/CD yaml edited

## Pull Request Creation

    - Tests
    - Related Issues
    - and so on...
